    "Working with data structures can be done in many ways in Python. There are the standard Python arrays, lists and tuples. You can also use the arrays in the numpy package which allow you to do heavy math operations efficiently. For data analysis Pandas is often used, because data can be put into so-called dataframes. Data-frames store data with column and row names and can easily be manipulated and plotted. You will learn more about Pandas in the Machine Learning workshops. A short intro can be found here:\n",
